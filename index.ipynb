    "Mental health has become an urgent public health concern across the globe, and Kenya is no exception. Approximately 25% of outpatients and 40% of inpatients in Kenyan healthcare facilities are affected by mental health conditions, according to the Kenyan National Commission of Human Rights. Depression, substance abuse, stress, and anxiety disorders are among the most commonly diagnosed mental health issues in hospital settings, a reflection of an alarming national trend. The situation is compounded by limited data on mental health, neurological issues, and substance use (MNS) in Kenya, making it challenging to address these concerns effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The World Health Organization (WHO) ranks Kenya among the African nations with the highest depression rates, with estimates suggesting that around two million Kenyans are impacted by depression alone. Disturbingly, one in four Kenyans will experience a mental health disorder at some point in their lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the urgent need to address mental health concerns, this project aims to leverage artificial intelligence to identify and analyze mental health indicators within social media text.\n",
    "\n",
    "By capturing and analyzing patterns of mental health issues expressed in public discourse, the project seeks to provide insights that can inform policymakers, healthcare providers, and support systems. In doing so, it contributes to a broader understanding of mental health in Kenya and aligns with the national objective of prioritizing mental well-being.\n",

This project aims to identify potential mental health concerns based on users’ language and conversational patterns in online texts."
